# Udacity-Agile-Software-Developer-Nanodegree

During this program, I completed three projects. 

1- WorldVisitz Mobile Application Agile Delivery Launch

I applied the Agile skills acquired during the first course in this project. I step into a business case as an Agile consultant to help WorldVisitz launch its new mobile application by defining an agile delivery solution to transform WorldVisitz's current traditional product development processes. 

For this project, I have created two presentations, one for WorldVisitz executives and the other for the WorldVisitz team.



2- Minimum Viable Product Plan

throughout this course, I learned that the Product Owner is mainly responsible for determining 'what' the development team works on and the priority of that work. In contrast, the development team determines 'how' the work should be completed. All members of an agile team must understand and can create a good product vision, product roadmap, and user stories. 

In this project, I applied the knowledge acquired during the second course, including creating a product vision, product roadmap, release plan, user stories with acceptance criteria, and, ultimately, MVP plan for a software product.



3- Excututing Agile with "Avengers Team."

For this project, "The Agile Software Company" has selected me to lead an Agile project that is mid-stream. The previous Agile Lead knew how to 'talk the talk' but couldn't 'walk the walk.' Instead of being a servant leader, the last Agile Lead directed people to do the work, telling every team member exactly how the result would be done. The previous Agile Lead didn't show anyone else the metrics, violating multiple agile concepts regarding transparency and openness.

Here are the main three requirements:
•	Management wants to know when the project will be done and ready to be used by the Customer.
•	The team needs to understand why they are doing what they are doing.
•	The Customer wants to know when they can get their hands on the MVP (minimum viable product).

Using all skills acquired during the Agile Nanodegree, I indicated which metrics are the key in determining when things will be done and what has been planned and completed. Next, I started to 'build the picture' of the project. The picture helps Management have confidence that the project will be transparently completed on time and within budget.
